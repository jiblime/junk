Notes: It is possible to use NTFS to include a .wim file larger than 4GB but it may not always work and is incredibly slow due to the ntfs driver

Install Windows 10 ISO from the **official site**
Alternative options: LTSC, Enterprise
Solution to gettinng a legal, $5 key: Ebay

Install woeusb
  Alternatively, grab a release from https://github.com/slacka/WoeUSB/releases
    This way you won't have to install its deps

Optional: Install GRUB with i386 (32bit) support. If you don't have this, WoeUSB will 'fail'. It will still work, but without
i386 files to install, it will think something is wrong.

mkfs.vfat -F32 -n WINDOWSISO /dev/the_usb
# Note that since --device is used, /dev/the_usb is used instead of /dev/the_usb1
woeusb --device /path/to/the/Windows.iso /dev/the_usb --workaround-bios-boot-flag

Important steps:
Mount the USB and make sure that efi/boot/bootx64.efi exists. Some motherboards will only boot from that.
If it's named something else, rename it to bootx64.efi.

Make sure grub/grub.cfg reads:

ntldr /bootmgr
boot

ESSENTIAL:
Do not set boot,esp flags on it. Otherwise there will be various failures such as 'missing' drivers,
incorrect assumption of the boot partition, etc.
